# Help restaurants survive the coronavirus pandemic with a free online ordering service

There are many restaurants that only served people in-house before the pandemic.

## Two user groups

1) Fancy sit-down places that costs a lot of money and do not deliver

2) Cash-only mom-n-pop places that have do not deliver. They are fundamentally incompatible with the credit-card systems of uber eats, grubhub, and seamless, and those services are too expensive anyway.

## Let's focus on mom-n-pop.

This is a huge change for them! They need online ordering systems! They haven't yet found good software to help them manage online orders, deliveries, and pickups.

- They have razor thin margins, so they cannot afford many of the online-order services

- They want to keep their staff employed, so they pay waiters and such to deliver food, instead of paying 3rd party delivery services

- Pickup lines can't get big during the pandemic, so they need time-slot reservations for pickups


## Solution: free and open source online ordering service

1) Allows people to order for pickup or delivery, with the option to pay in cash

2) Allows restaurants to set limits on number of deliveries or pickups per time slot

We can run a free version on an amazon server while the pandemic continues, and we potentially add a paid tier or ask for donations if the costs get too high, but always provide the source code with instructions on how to setup your own server, if someone wants to reduce costs
